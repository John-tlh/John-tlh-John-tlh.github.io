From tomorrow on, I will be a happy man.

Grooming,chopping and traveling all over the word.

From tomorrow on, I will care foodstuff and vegetable.

Living in a house towards the sea, with spring blossoms.

From tomorrow on, write to each of my dear ones.

Telling them of my happiness.

What the lightening of happiness has told me.

I will spread it to each of them.

Give a warm name for every river and every mountain.

Strangers, I will also wish you happy.

May you have a brilliant future !

May you lovers eventually becomes spouses !

May you enjoy happiness in this earthly word !

I only wish to face the sea, with spring blossoms.

做个爱自己的人、读书、吃饭、多睡觉，健谈、健体、不油腻。
